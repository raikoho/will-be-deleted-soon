## Risk

Simply put, a risk is the possibility of a negative impact on practically anything i.e., business, financial, security, there are many areas where risk may reside.

Management of risk is done by applying controls to bring the risk to an acceptable level. Risk can be at different levels in an organization, from a single piece of equipment to a whole department or division.

**Risk assessments** are conducted to identify and determine the impacts of risk, the likelihood and the consequences should a risk materialize. These can help organizations make informed decisions based on the outcome of the assessment.

**Conducting a risk assesment:**

- Identifying potential hazards
- Identifying who might be harmed by those hazards
- Evaluating risk (severity and likelihood) and establishing suitable precautions
- Implementing controls and recording your findings
- Review your assessment and re-assessing if necessary.

#### Risk Managing:

**Risk Mitigation:** It involves applying technical controls such as patches and firewalls as well as administrative ones like policies and procedures, quite common for most security teams to choose.

**Risk Transfer:** This is a way to shift the cost of a potential loss to another person or organization—insurance is a popular method with this one.

**Risk Accept:** Risk acceptance means proceeding despite the possible harm. This is quite common for businesses to adopt, given that some risks are unavoidable or irrelevant.

**Risk Avoid:** The most effective—strategy that aims to prevent an incident from occurring at all by eliminating any hazards that might harm the business.

## Policies and Procedures

A policy is a plan of intent or course of action towards a particular domain. 
This could be a country’s attitude towards an issue or a business’s plan of responsibility. 
Policies guide actions in many ways. Some policies are laws or regulations whereas some are principles, direction, or guidelines. 
They range in complexity, from home to office and government. 
Policies are at the highest level, followed by procedures and standards, and then guidelines.

#### Why it is used?

A policy outlines rules and provides principles that guide the actions to be taken, it will set out roles and responsibilities that can be accountable.

You have followed policies all your life and may never have thought of it. For example, “No TV until homework is done” or “bedtime at 8 pm”, are policies commonly laid down by parents. These are simple and easy to understand; consequences may include loss of TV privileges or no treats. Policies laid down in business and government will be more complex and have more serious consequences. For example, an insurance policy is a very detailed agreement between you and the insurance provider.

Policies may also be a collection of policies, and IT Security policy will have other policies pertaining to it. Any new employee will be expected to, read, and sign an acceptable use policy to use company assets. It may also include a policy on the use of personal devices. Knowing and understanding an organization's policy is vital to operations, most companies will have many policies. A good practice is to have a detailed knowledge of the policies relevant to your roles and responsibilities, but to be aware of other policies and know where to seek guidance on them as they are often interlinked.

#### Policies Examples

**Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)**

This is a document that stipulates what a user can and cannot do on a corporate, university, or internet service provider (ISP) network and /or internet access. The user agrees to the terms laid out by the policy to gain access to the network. A code of conduct governs the behavior of the user while using the network/internet provided to them; such as no social media or adult content. These policies should outline the consequences in case a user violates this agreement, for example, loss of internet privileges or suspension of the account.

**Service Level Agreement (SLA)**

A service level agreement lays out a set level of commitment between a service provider and a customer. For example, an internet service provider or cloud provider will have included a service level agreement when you take out their services. This will dictate; the services provided, performance levels, resolution response times, and repercussions if the service is not provided.

**Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)**

This is a policy that outlines the usage of a personally owned device on a corporate network, such as a laptop or mobile phone.

**Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)**

A Memorandum of Understanding is a document that formally outlines an agreement between two or more parties but, is not legally binding. An MOU is usually a sign that a binding contract is imminent.

#### Standard Operating Procedures

A standard operating procedure is a step-by-step set of instructions developed for a routine task. They provide specific technical processes and techniques used to complete a set task.

## Compliance and Frameworks

Compliance is defined as following rules and meeting requirements for specified frameworks. Organizations operating in different industries will have specific compliance frameworks that they need to comply with.

#### **ISO 27001**

**ISO/IEC 27001** is an information security standard, part of the ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards, of which the last version was published in 2013, with a few minor updates since then. It is published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) under the joint ISO and IEC subcommittee.

[ISO/IEC 27001](https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html) specifies a management system that is intended to bring information security under management control and gives specific requirements. Organizations that meet the requirements may be certified by an accredited certification body following the successful completion of an audit.

#### **PCI DSS**

The **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard** (**PCI DSS**) is a security standard for organizations that handle branded credit cards from the major card schemes. The PCI Standard is mandated by the card brands but administered by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council. The standard was created to increase controls around cardholder data to reduce credit card fraud. 

Validation of compliance is performed annually or quarterly, [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard#cite_note-1)by a method suited to the volume of payment transactions handled:

- **Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ)** — smaller volumes
- **External Qualified Security Assessor (QSA)** — moderate volumes
- **Firm-specific Internal Security Assessor (ISA)** — larger volumes; involves issuing a Report on Compliance

#### **HIPAA**

**Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)** is a regulation intended to help covered entities and their business associates protect Electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI).  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) outlines who HIPAA applies to in its definition of a covered entity. HIPAA applies to companies that provide services that would use e-PHI such as suppliers or outsourced IT providers.

The primary goal of HIPAA is to protect ePHI which includes, name, dates such as birth, admission, discharge, death, telephone number, SSN, photographs, address, etc.  Companies under this regulation will need to implement technical and procedural controls to protect this information and perform risk analysis on risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI. Technical controls include such things as encryption, authentication, password complexity, access auditing, segmentation, etc., and procedural controls include such things as password policies, incident response plans, contingency plans, and audit procedures.

#### **General Data Protection Regulation**

The **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy in the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA). It also addresses the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas, with the primary aim to give control to individuals over their personal data.

Controllers and processors of personal data must put in place _appropriate technical and organizational measures_ to implement the data protection principles. Business processes that handle personal data must be designed and built with consideration of the principles and provide safeguards to protect data (for example, using pseudonymization or full anonymization where appropriate). Data controllers must design information systems with privacy in mind, for instance, use the highest-possible privacy settings by default, so that the datasets are not publicly available by default, and cannot be used to identify a subject. No personal data may be processed unless this processing is done under one of six lawful bases specified by the regulation (consent, contract, public task, vital interest, legitimate interest, or legal requirement). When the processing is based on consent the data subject has the right to revoke it at any time.
