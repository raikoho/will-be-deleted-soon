We can use various tools to create a memory dump, a file containing the contents of the system's memory at the time of acquisition, such as LiME ([https://github.com/504ensicsLabs/LiME](https://github.com/504ensicsLabs/LiME)) and memdump ([https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/memdump.1.html)](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/memdump.1.html\)).

You'll have a chance to perform memory forensics in the Volatility section of the **digital forensics** domain, to understand what information can be obtained from a memory dump!
