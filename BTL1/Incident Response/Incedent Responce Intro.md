This section is intended to provide an introduction to incident response. Therefore (and with the purpose of presenting good practices in this field) we will make use of the [NIST SP 800-61r2](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf) incident response standard.

The NIST incident response lifecycle also includes a preparation stage, where security controls are considered and deployed to reduce the likelihood and impact of a successful cyberattack.
# What is Incident Response?

Incident response is the methodology an organization uses to respond to and manage a cyber attack.

**Large organizations** will typically have their own dedicated team, often called a CSIRT – Computer Security Incident Response Team. This team isn’t just comprised of security professionals, it should also include general IT staff, and employees from departments such as HR, communications/public relations, legal, and C-suite level members.

# Why is Incident Response Needed?

Incident response benefits the wider business by reducing the impact of successful attacks and allowing business operations to remain as uninterrupted as possible. 

It’s impossible to completely prevent any incident from occurring, so incident response helps to minimize the impact. Successful cyberattacks can have a number of adverse consequences, such as data breaches, and events where information an organization stores is exfiltrated. 

Data breaches can cause immense damage in terms of lost customer trust and business, monetary losses from recovering damaged or infected systems, stock prices dropping, hiring external security teams to help contain the breach, and legal or regulatory fines such as those under legislation including the [General Data Protection Regulation](https://gdpr-info.eu/) (for EU countries, or organizations that process data belonging to EU data subjects). Just to give you an example of how heavy GDPR and regulatory fines can be, we have composed a list of some recent breaches:

1. Google - €50 million (January 2019) by CNIL, France.
2. H&M Hennes & Mauritz Online Shop A.B. & Co. KG - €35.3 million (October 2020) by HmbBfDI, Germany.
3. TIM (Telecom Italia) - €27.8 million (January 2020) by Garante, Italy.
4. Austrian Post - €18 million (October 2019) by DSB, Austria.
5. Marriott International - £18.4 million (October 2020) by ICO, United Kingdom.
6. British Airways - £20 million (October 2020) by ICO, United Kingdom.
7. Deutsche Wohnen SE - €14.5 million (November 2019) by Berlin DPA, Germany.
8. Eni Gas e Luce - €11.5 million (July 2020) by Garante, Italy.
9. 1&1 Telecom GmbH - €9.55 million (December 2019) by BfDI, Germany.
10. Vodafone Spain - €8.15 million (February 2021) by AEPD, Spain.

Legal and regulatory fines can be too much for smaller organizations and can result in them shutting down or having to change how they operate, such as no longer allowing customers from within EU countries.

Incident response isn’t just about responding to data breaches, it involves responding to the aftermath of an attack such as:

- **Employee credentials being leaked online**
- **Database leaks**
- **Malware infections, such as ransomware**
- **A stolen employee laptop**
- **Website defacement**
- **An employee trying to smuggle sensitive data out of the company**

Having written plans to follow if these occur helps to reduce the risk by responding and containing the threat appropriately. We will cover incident response plans in the **Preparation: Incident Response Plan** lesson in the next section.

And remember, if the cost of running an incident response team is less than the cost of a GDPR or other regulatory fine, then the business is saving money!
