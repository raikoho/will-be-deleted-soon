You are free to start your exam whenever you want, regardless of training or lab completion, however you must have valid exam access (12 months from date of purchase) and 1 or more exam attempts remaining (we provide 2 free exam attempts with BTL1).

All you need to do is go to the ‘Exams’ tab and click ‘Start Exam’. After the lab loads (approximately 5-10 minutes) then you'll be able to connect to it through your browser using the same button.

If you accidentally close your browser windows, you can open it again using this same button.

After you have answered the questions within the exam client and submitted your final answers, you'll see your exam attempt appears at the bottom of the page.
