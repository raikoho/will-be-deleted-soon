Below are a number of tips that you should follow, giving you the best chance of scoring highly in the exam and becoming certified.

- **Complete all The Course Content –** The training content has been created to provide you with the knowledge and skills to pass the exam. We highly recommend that all students have 100% course and lab progress before starting their exam.

- **Don’t Rush –** Seriously, slow down and think things over. It’s easy to rush into things, but this means you may miss obvious information which is crucial to the exam scenario.

- **… But Don’t Go Slow Either –** Remember you have up to 24 hours of access to the exam lab, so make sure you have some dedicated time to focus purely on the exam. We have set the exam duration to be this long to provide you with flexibility, so eat, get some sleep, take breaks. This is more than enough time to complete your investigations, but keep an eye on the clock.

- **Make Sure you Have Good Notes –** If you don’t already, go back and take notes from the course, this will make it a lot easier than having to find specific information while you are running through the exam. It’s a good idea to note down how to use tools and any related commands, but remember that cheatsheets exist online!

- **Use the course ‘Bookmarks’ feature –** This is a great way to flag lessons that you think will be useful in the exam, so you can get back to them with a single click!

- **Read the Exam Brief. No, Seriously, Read it –** The whole point of this information, which you’ll be able to view on the sidebar in your lab environment, is to gently guide you through the scenario and tell you what information you need to collect. It will introduce you to the entire scenario so that you understand what’s happened, and what needs to be done.

- **Write a Timeline –** Writing an incident timeline on your host machine during the exam can help you to link events together. Write down the timestamp of a key event and do this for everything major you find, it'll help you build up the bigger picture.
