## Section 1 – Apps Panel

- The **Apps** panel lists the applications that are installed on your Splunk instance. The list shows only the apps that you have permission to view.
- When you first open Splunk Web, you will see the default and pre-installed App, **Search & Reporting**, in the Apps panel.
- Because we have other Apps installed (from configuring BOTSv1) we can see them listed on the left-hand side.

## Section 2 – Splunk Bar

- The Splunk bar appears on every page in Splunk Web. You use this bar to switch between apps, configure your Splunk deployment, view system-level messages, and monitor the progress of search jobs.

## Section 3 – Explore Splunk Panel

- The Explore Splunk panel contains links to pages where you can get help.
- You can take a product tour, add data, browse for new apps, or access the documentation.

## Section 4 – Home Dashboard

- Once dashboards have been created (we’ll cover this later), we can set a dashboard to display on our homepage, which will be visible in the area marked “4”.
- We can use this dashboard to immediately view information that is important to us, such as the number of alerts, types of attacks, and much more.
